# Project: Multi-threaded Matrix Operations in C/C++ 
## Overview
This project involves the development of a multi-threaded application designed to perform certain matrix operations, ensuring synchronization via mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables.

The primary goal is to maintain the integrity of the values while performing operations on four matrices using separate threads. The operations include addition of the first two matrices and the last two matrices, followed by multiplication of the results of these additions.
